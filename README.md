# Information models implemented in OPC UA (IEC 62541) by Equinor

In this repository Equinor is making OPC UA information models available as open source so that everybody, free of charge, can take advantage of what we have done and further develop it. Some of these OPC UA informations will consist of Equinor-specific informatiion, some of them are based on other standards (that only exists as documents) and some of them are sub-typed from OPC UA companion specifications. The OPC UA information models published here are **not** OPC UA companion specifications. All joint OPC UA companion specifications are published at https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-Nodeset (The NodeSet XML files) and https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v104/ (document describing the companion specification).
